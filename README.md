# SMC CS 80 Chat App Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a basic chat system using a standard 
implementation stack to serve as an example of a full-stack web application
developed with modern code principles.

Features of the application have been intentionally left out in this version of
the project, and left as exercises to the student.
